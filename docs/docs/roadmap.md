# Roadmap

Efesto does not have a "proper" roadmap. There are, however, some features that
may be implemented in the future:

- `/random` endpoint fragment to get random items from a collection
- Batch POST, PATCH and DELETE requests to collections endpoints
- Nested embeds
- Option to have created and updated columns for custom tables
- Option to disallowing `/types`, `/fields` and `/users` endpoints
- Support different HATEOAS formats
